          <p>I have a keen interest in the cross section between humans and technology. How we interact with technology, how we teach technology and how technology can help evolve companies (both I don't believe in technology in the sake of technology).</p>
          <p>I believe that knowledge obtained in a playful and diverse environment, is the key to a successful technology adoption and implementation.</p>
