Personally I think that a better word for teaching is "Knowledge facilitation", or at least its a more descriptive word to how I think teaching should be carried out.

I teach in many areas of of software development, I prefer my classes to be hands-on with either assignments or projects and required the students to seek information on their own.

Courses I have taught:
* Cyber security
* Web-development backend (.NET)
* Data access using .NET
* Produce and deliver software
* Development of cloud based applications

The outcome of teaching is learning, and learning is the reflection of what you know, it's about making sense of an experience or knowledge and incorporating this into our own mental model of the world or software for that sake.
We build our learning our existing knowledge and experience, so no student is alike, neither before or after the teaching session.

In my opinion is the border between teaching and play extremely thin, and if teaching is done right is it play, but if work is done right is it also play.
It is reasonable to conclude that enjoyment and learning are two sides of the same coin.
