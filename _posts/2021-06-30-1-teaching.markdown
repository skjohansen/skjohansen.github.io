I perform teaching in many areas of programing, my style is "flipped classroom" where I provide the students the needed knowledge in the start of the class, and the rest is hands-on training.

I have though:
* Cybersecurity
* Webdevelopment backend (.NET)
* Data access using .NET
* Produce and deliver software
* Development of cloud based applications
