*“Slow and steady wins the race.”* – A timeless lesson from the tale of the [Hare and the Tortoise](https://read.gov/aesop/025.html). In the fast-paced world of software development, this classic fable offers more than just a moral about humility and perseverance—it provides valuable insights into how we handle bugs in our projects.

As decision-makers in software development, you’re constantly balancing [resources, scope, quality, and time](https://wiki.c2.com/?FourVariables). One critical decision is whether to fix bugs immediately or to backlog them for later resolution. Let’s explore why adopting a **Zero Bug Strategy**—fixing bugs as they arise—might just be the tortoise-like approach that ensures your project’s success, backed by some straightforward reasoning.

### Bugs and defects
Building something that works, but disagrees with the specification is a defect. Building something that follows specification but dosent work is due to bugs.

By adopting BDD and/or TDD do we eleminate defects as much as possible. Left is the bugs.

Bugs occour when ever our systems is put into production and meet realife users.

## The Hare’s Temptation: Backlogging Bugs

Imagine your project is like the Hare from our favorite fable. Fast, energetic, and eager to push features out, you might be tempted to backlog bugs—cataloging them for future fixes. At first glance, this seems efficient. You’re moving quickly, delivering features, and keeping the sprint velocity high. But just like the Hare’s overconfidence, this approach can lead to unexpected pitfalls.

## The Tortoise’s Wisdom: Zero Bugs Strategy

On the other hand, the Tortoise represents a methodical, steady approach—akin to the Zero Bugs Strategy. The Zero Bugs Strategy is not a new thing, one of the first usage in a large scale was at Microsoft where a [Zero-defects code memo](https://sriramk.com/memos/zerodef.pdf) was send out on 1989-06-20, the main point in this memo being that *done* should mean *done-done*.
This strategy emphasizes fixing bugs immediately rather than deferring them. You might wonder, “Why spend time fixing bugs right away when we can address them later?” Let’s break it down.

## Why Fixing Bugs Immediately Makes Sense

Delaying bug fixes can lead to increased costs down the line. Imagine each bug as a small hole in a boat. Ignoring one might not sink you, but ignoring many can lead to bigger problems. The longer a bug remains unfixed, the more complex and costly it becomes to address. Fixing bugs promptly prevents these escalating costs, ensuring your project remains on budget. Additionally, unresolved bugs can affect user experience, leading to dissatisfaction and potential loss of customers. By adopting a Zero Bugs Strategy, you maintain high-quality standards, fostering trust and loyalty among your users.

Moreover, backlogging bugs contributes to technical debt—the future work required to fix issues that weren’t addressed promptly. High technical debt can slow down development, making future changes more difficult and time-consuming. Addressing bugs immediately helps keep your codebase clean and manageable. Some bugs can trigger additional issues, creating a domino effect of problems. Fixing bugs as they arise helps prevent these cascade effects, ensuring that one issue doesn’t lead to many more.

## The Scrum Conundrum: Why Bugs Don’t Belong in Story Points

In the realm of Scrum, a popular agile framework, the temptation to estimate bugs using story points can be particularly strong. However, this practice can undermine the very foundation of your team's productivity and morale. Bugs should be viewed as indicators of quality issues rather than tasks to be quantified and added to the backlog. When bugs are estimated and assigned story points, it inadvertently signals that poor quality is acceptable and can be accounted for within the team’s velocity. This approach can create a misleading sense of progress, as the team’s velocity might appear higher while masking the underlying quality problems that need immediate attention.

Furthermore, estimating bugs often leads to inaccuracies because the time required to fix them is inherently uncertain. Unlike feature development, where requirements are clear and tasks are more predictable, bugs can vary widely in complexity and impact. Attempting to assign story points to bugs can disrupt the sprint planning process, as the team struggles to accommodate unpredictable workloads. Instead of inflating velocity metrics with unresolved issues, it makes more sense to address bugs directly. This focus not only improves product quality but also provides a more accurate reflection of the team’s true velocity, fostering a healthier and more transparent development environment.

Should we against all recomendations start to backlog our bugs should we treate the bugs as any other kind of work, meaning that there should be no difference in bugs and PBIs, and that the bugs should be priotitized by the customers like any other work in the application.

## The Mathematical Backbone: Simple Logic, Big Impact

You don’t need to be a mathematician to understand the logic here. Think of it this way:

- **Immediate Fixing Costs \\((C_f)\\)**: The cost of fixing a bug right away.
- **Backlogging Costs \\((C_b + R(D))\\)**: The cost of backlogging a bug includes the initial delay \\(C_b\\) plus the rising costs over time \\(R(D)\\).

When you fix bugs immediately, your total cost is straightforward and predictable. However, when you backlog bugs, not only do you incur the initial delay, but the costs also grow over time as the bugs potentially worsen or affect other parts of the project.

Mathematically, it’s clear:
\\[ \text{Cumulative Cost of Backlogging} \geq \text{Cost of Immediate Fixing} \\]

In simple terms, fixing bugs as they come saves you more money and headaches in the long run.

## The Moral of the Story

Just like the Tortoise’s steady pace won the race, the Zero Bugs Strategy—fixing bugs immediately—ensures a smoother, more cost-effective journey for your software projects. While the Hare’s speed is admirable, it’s the consistent, reliable approach of the Tortoise that leads to sustained success.

## Conclusion

In the race of software development, don’t let the temptation to backlog bugs make you the Hare who loses focus. Embrace the Zero Bugs Strategy and adopt the Tortoise’s wisdom. By fixing bugs immediately, you enhance quality, reduce costs, and ensure your project stays on track to victory.

Remember, in the world of software, slow and steady not only wins the race—it builds a product that stands the test of time.


## P.S. The Mathematical Proof Behind the Zero Bugs Strategy

For those interested in the detailed reasoning that underpins the Zero Bugs Strategy, here's a mathematical explanation demonstrating why fixing bugs immediately is more cost-effective than backlogging them.

### Assumptions and Definitions

Let’s define the following variables:

- \\( C_f \\): Cost of fixing a bug **immediately**.
- \\( C_b \\): Cost of **backlogging** (estimating and storing) a bug, including initial overhead.
- \\( D \\): The delay between identifying a bug and its eventual fix if backlogged.
- \\( R(D) \\): Additional costs incurred due to the delay \( D \), such as increased complexity, customer dissatisfaction, or further bugs.
- \\( N \\): Total number of bugs identified in the project.

### Scenario 1: Fixing Bugs Immediately

When bugs are fixed as they are found, the total cost is simply:

\\[
C_{\text{total\_f}} = N \times C_f
\\]

This represents the straightforward cost of addressing each bug without delay.

### Scenario 2: Backlogging Bugs

When bugs are backlogged, the total cost comprises the initial backlog cost plus the additional costs incurred over time due to the delay:

\\[
C_{\text{total\_b}} = N \times C_b + \sum_{i=1}^{N} R(D_i)
\\]

Here, \\( R(D_i) \\) represents the additional cost for each bug \\( i \\) based on its specific delay \\( D_i \\).

### Comparing the Two Scenarios

To determine which approach is more cost-effective, we compare the total costs:

\\[
C_{\text{total\_b}} < C_{\text{total\_f}}
\\]

Substituting the expressions:

\\[
N \times C_b + \sum_{i=1}^{N} R(D_i) < N \times C_f
\\]

Dividing both sides by \\( N \\):

\\[
C_b + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R(D_i) < C_f
\\]

### Proving Non-Rentability of Backlogging

To show that backlogging is **not** cost-effective, we need to prove:

\\[
C_b + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R(D_i) \geq C_f
\\]

**Reasoning:**

1. **Cost of Backlogging (\\( C_b \\))**: Typically, \\( C_b \\) includes overhead costs such as tracking, estimating, and prioritizing bugs. It often equals or exceeds \\( C_f \\), the cost of immediate fixing.

2. **Additional Costs (\\( R(D) \\))**: The function \\( R(D) \\) is designed to capture the escalating costs associated with delays. Commonly, \\( R(D) \\) is a **non-decreasing function** of \\( D \\), meaning costs grow as delays increase. For example, \\( R(D) = k \ln(D) \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, models how costs increase logarithmically with delay.

Given these points:

- \\( C_b \geq C_f \\): The initial cost of backlogging is at least as much as fixing immediately.
- \\( R(D) \\) increases with \\( D \\): Any delay introduces additional costs.

Thus:

\\[
C_b + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R(D_i) \geq C_f + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R(D_i) > C_f
\\]

This inequality shows that the **total cost of backlogging** is always **greater than or equal to** the cost of fixing bugs immediately.

### Conclusion of the Mathematical Proof

The mathematical analysis confirms that backlogging bugs leads to higher or equal total costs compared to fixing them right away. This is primarily due to the inherent overhead of managing a backlog and the additional expenses that arise from delaying bug fixes. Therefore, adopting a **Zero Bugs Strategy**—where bugs are addressed immediately—ensures greater cost efficiency and maintains higher quality standards within your software projects.

By integrating this mathematical perspective, it's clear that the Zero Bugs Strategy not only aligns with practical development best practices but also stands on solid economic ground, making it the superior choice for successful and sustainable software development.
