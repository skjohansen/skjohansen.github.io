By nature are we humans build to strive for new learning, and as children we accomplish this through play. Play makes us feel alive and helps us discover new limits and new possibilities

> "When we stop playing, we stop developing, and when that happens the laws of entropy take over - things fall apart."

**I believe** that we should start to embrace play at work, this does not mean that our offices should be full of toys, but it means that we should start to on purpose make activities playful.

An activity is playful if it is:
1. Fully absorbing
2. Intrinsically motivated
3. Include elements of uncertainty and surprise
4. If it motivates a sense of illusion or exaggeration

Within software development we often talk about developers being "in the zone", in my opinion this is actually another way to phrase that the developer is "playing". While it is our nature to keep playing as we grow, adults often or suppress the use of this transformative power, and we risk to loos out on a lot of energy and imagination which playing enables. Even worse does many organizations have some very unhealthy and brain-unfriendly working patterns when it comes to demanding that their employees be constantly "on".

**Imagination** is our mental capacity to conceive of what is not, and one can argue that if imagination is the ability to conceive what is not, then **creativity** is imagination applied.
